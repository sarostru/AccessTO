This is an interface to receive http GET requests from a mobile device
and return the results as a formatted list.

We have our data available in a fusion table:
	https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=2338762

We have an earlier version of the code contained here running on appengine:
   http://accessprto.appspot.com

It responds to two types of queries:
   Find two closest services to a given lat/long pair:
   http://accessprto.appspot.com/nearby?service=pool&latitude=43000000&longitude=-7900000 

   Return a service info given its id:
   http://accessprto.appspot.com/name?name=4

The results are not properly formatted as the mobile/db interface is not yet implemented.


The update_fusion.py adds to each entry a lat/lng coordinate by using the google maps api.
I tried it on a couple of samples, we will be updating the entire table offline.
